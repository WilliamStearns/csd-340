    <h2>Chapter 1: Getting to Know Me</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I was born and raised in Polk, Nebraska, a small town.
      Growing up in a close-knit community taught me the value of hard work and strong relationships.
      <span class="sentence">Even though it was a small place, it had a big impact on who I am today.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve always been interested in creative work, like writing stories or editing music tracks. 
      As a kid, I would spend hours coming up with characters and drawing maps of imaginary worlds.
      That creative spark still drives me, especially as I work toward a degree in software development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of school, I love cooking new recipes, watching drag competitions, and hanging out with my three cats.
      I’m also a huge fan of video games, especially Pokémon, and I find them a fun way to relax and challenge myself.
      Learning new skills through coding and problem-solving is something I really enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to college after a long break wasn’t easy, but it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve made.
      I’m thankful to have a support system that encourages me, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come.
      Every course I take feels like a step closer to a career that fits me.
